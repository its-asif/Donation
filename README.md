# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Features

- **User-Friendly Navigation:** The website features a straightforward and easy-to-use navigation menu with clearly labeled sections: "Home," "Donation," and "Statistics." Users can quickly access different parts of the website.

- **Dynamic Donation Cards:** On the homepage, users can explore a collection of dynamic donation cards. Each card displays important details such as a picture, title, category, and pricing information. The use of distinct colors for backgrounds and text enhances the visual appeal.

- **Detailed Donation Pages:** Clicking on a donation card leads users to dedicated donation detail pages. Here, they can access comprehensive information, including images, titles, descriptions, and donation amounts. An interactive "Donate" button ensures a seamless donation process with meaningful success notifications.

- **Donation History:** The "Donation" page allows users to track their donation history. Donation cards are presented in rows of two, providing a clear overview of previous contributions. The option to view additional donations via the "See All" button enhances usability.

- **Statistics and Pie Chart:** The website includes a dedicated "Statistics" page featuring a pie chart. This chart visually represents the user's donations against the total donations made, displaying the percentage of contributions. It provides users with a clear understanding of their impact.
